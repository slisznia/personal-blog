On my road to IFR cert: 
* log 50 hours of cross-country flight time
* 40 hours of actual or simulated instrument time, of which 15 must be with a CFII
   - 3 hours in an appropriate airplane and within two calendar months of the checkride
   - an IFR cross-country with an instructor (250NM, an approach at each airport and 3 kinds of approaches)
