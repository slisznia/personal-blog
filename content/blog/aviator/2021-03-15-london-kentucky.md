On March 12th, we flew to Kentucky. Originally, we planned to fly to Knoxville, Tennessee however IMC conditions prevented safe flight to our intended destination. We landed earlier - at KLOZ - and stayed overnight in London, KY. Curtesy of AllTrails, we found an amazing hike to "Pine Island Double Falls".
