My friendship with Rajesh dates back to early 2000. We met at The Options Clearing Corp in Chicago where we both worked as C++ programmers. We've always had a lot of fun and hang out together to this day.

Other than complaining about the low cabin temperature, Rajesh took it great.

In April of 2011, along with 4 awesome people, we took a bike trip through California and Nevada.
